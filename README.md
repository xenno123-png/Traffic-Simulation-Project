# Traffic-Simulation-Project
Efficient management of traffic flow and finding the shortest route between two points is essential to reduce travel time, fuel consumption, and overall pollution. The motivation behind this project is to simulate and study how cars move across a city road network and how congestion can be represented using fundamental data structures.
